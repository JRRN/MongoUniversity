Final: Lab 1

The items.js file implements data access for the item collection. The item collection contains the product catalog for the MongoMart application.

The mongomart.js application instantiates an item data access object (DAO) with this call:

var items = new ItemDAO(db);
The DAO, items, is used throughout mongomart.js to implement several of the routes in this application.

In this lab, you will implement the methods in items.js necessary to support the root route or "/". This route is implemented in mongomart.js in the function that begins with this line:

router.get("/", function(req, res) {
The methods you will implement in items.js are: getCategories(), getItems(), and getNumItems(). The comments in each of these methods describe in detail what you need to do to implement each method. When you are finished, restart mongomart.js application and answer the question below.
The first page of products contains a "Track Jacket", "Coffee Mug", and "Women's T-shirt". Which of the following items are found on the third page?
