In this lab, you will implement the method in cart.js necessary for updating the quantity of an item in a user's cart. The method you will implement in cart.js is updateQuantity(). This method is called from mongomart.js both when clicking "Add to cart" from the single item view page and when updating the quantity of an item using the quantity selector for an item in the user cart view.

The comments in updateQuantity() describe what you need to do to implement it. When you are finished, restart mongomart.js application and test that both methods of increasing the quantity for an item in the cart work. Note that you should also be able to remove an item from the cart by setting the quantity to 0.
